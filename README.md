# Student Management System

Our theme is object-oriented programming.
This is our student management system. 

It can show student's information, includes number, name, id, score and grade.
You can add and delete student.

You can sort students in ascending order by ID or descending order by score.

The system can use a bar chart to display the distribution of student scores and calculate the mean, mode, range, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the scores.

The File menu allows you to create a new student list, open a .xlsx file, export a .xlsx file, and exit system.

The Students.xlsx file is an example of an imported file.
